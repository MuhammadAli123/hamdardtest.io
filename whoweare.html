                                        <p>Hamdard is not merely a commercial enterprise but is an institution of social welfare. It has dedicated itself to national uplift and welfare of the people. Its entire proceeds are spent in national and international humanitarian pursuits, through Hamdard Foundation Pakistan.</p> 
                                        <p>Hamdard Foundation Pakistan has a broad-based programme that includes the establishment of educational institutions, professional colleges, hospitals and free mobile dispensaries providing free or low-cost treatment to the common man; plus research laboratories, institutes and many other social welfare and philanthropic activities.</p>
                                        <p>To administer and control the philanthropy separately and independently from a business unit, the Hamdard Foundation Pakistan was established in 1964. 
                                        It is the first NGO of its kind that came into being in Pakistan. 
                                        Hamdard Foundation Pakistan looks towards Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf), the manufacturing arm of the organization, for financial support of its projects and programmes of public welfare to serve humanity. 
                                        The Foundation has certain general objectives, such as establishment of academic, educational, professional and commercial institutes for the welfare of society, and to assist those already in existence, building of schools, training institutes and programmes, as well to assist authors, writers, intellectuals, scholars and teachers in their academic pursuits.</p>

                                    <p>Hakeem Hafiz Abdul Majeed established Hamdard Dawakhana at Delhi, India in 1906. </p>
                                    <p>The Dawakhana soon gained a high reputation throughout the city as the finest supplier of herbs and, by 1920, acquired the status of one of the finest pharmacies.</p>
                                    <p>The premature death of Hakeem Hafiz Abdul Majeed in 1922, at the age of only 40, was a big shock to the family. His three sons were too young to take over the affairs of Hamdard. However, Rabia Begum, the widow of Late Abdul Majeed, took command until Hakeem Abdul Hameed, the eldest son, assumed leadership.</p>

                                            <br>
                                        <p>The second/middle son, Abdul Waheed, died in his teens. In 1940, Hakim Mohammed Said, now of age, joined Hamdard and by 1947, Hamdard became a prominent manufacturer of herbal products and medicines in the subcontinent.<br>
                                        After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Hakim Mohammed Said, at the age of 28 migrated to Pakistan, and in the year of 1948 he established Hamdard Pakistan in Karachi, on a modest scale.</p> <br>
                                        <p>Hakim Mohammed Said was a man of determination and rare qualities. By sheer dint of his labour, dynamism, and native genius, he was able to make Hamdard the leading manufacturer of herbal medicines and products in Pakistan in a span of just six years.</p> 
                                        <p>In 1953, by which time Hamdard had become a big pharmaceutical company, Hakim Mohammed Said declared it a ‘Waqf’ (Trust). The ‘Waqf’ has a religious basis, is irrevocable and is considered to be under the ownership of Al-Mighty Allah. (It is an article of faith with Muslims that everything in this world belongs to Al-Mighty Allah and man is only permitted a justifiable use of it.) The profits generated by a ‘Waqf’ belong not to any individual or family but are used for charitable or nation-building purposes.</p>
                                        <p>Hakim Mohammed Said possessed innumerable qualities of head and heart and had a vivid imagination. He realized that it was becoming difficult for Hamdard (Waqf) to manage the business as well as the charitable and welfare activities and therefore he decided to establish Hamdard Foundation Pakistan to look after the humanitarian affairs of Hamdard. In one of his books he says, “Wealth is that sticky smog which destroys the luster of the soul for every” – thus he endowed all the profits of Hamdard (Waqf) to Hamdard Foundation Pakistan to carry out its charitable, educational and other philanthropic activities”.</p>
                                        <p>On 23rd October 1969 the rules & regulations of Hamdard Foundation Pakistan were registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.</p>
                                        <p>A lot of philanthropic activities were initiated and completed by Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) Pakistan, during the period 1953 to 1963.</p>
                                        <p>These philanthropic activities were, however, administratively separated from Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) Pakistan on 1st January 1964 by establishing Hamdard Foundation Pakistan. Since then Hamdard Foundation Pakistan is involved in various types of philanthropic activities. Expansions are being made in these activities rapidly and systematically.</p>

                                    <a><h4>Journey of Hamdard Foundation Pakistan</h4></a>
                                    <p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. The journey of Hamdard Pakistan a non-governmental organization began in 1948 when after the birth of Pakistan Hakim Mohammed Said, Founder President of Hamdard in Pakistan established Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) at Karachi for the manufacture of Herbal medicines. Within a few years from modest beginning and after trials and tribulations it grew into a leading national institution in the field of herbal medicines. Demand, progress and expansion demanded more space. Today Hamdard Industrial Complex or “Hamdard Sanaat Abad” as it is known, spread on 32 acres of land, has transformed a conservative pharmaceutical industry into a modern scientific one, serving national and international demands</p>
                                    <a class="more_btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#journey">Read More</a>
                                    <div id="journey" class="collapse"> <br>
                                        <p>In 1953 Hamdard from being a national institution became a national trust when Hakim Mohammed Said sole owner of the thriving prosperous Hamdard created “The Hamdard Foundation Pakistan” to channelize its philanthropy</p>
                                        <p>The core motto and philosophy of Hamdard Foundation is service of Humanity through Medical, Scientific, Educational and Cultural activities. Since then through hard work and dedication Hamdard has risen to an eminent position in the Philanthropic world as a non-governmental organization promoting health education, education, science and culture, aligning itself with the noble ideals of global organizations such as World Health Organizations (WHO), UNESCO, UNICEF and the International Union for Health Promotion and Education</p>
                                        <p>Now the journey began with the production of Herbal Medicine to succor the sick and the ailing took arm and added dimensions. Every man has a dream for the future. The dream of Hakim Mohammed Said was to establish a City of Education, Science and Culture. This dream became a reality when in the 80’s he built the city of Madinat al-Hikmah on 350 acres of desert scrubby land near Karachi where now countless flowers of education bloom.</p>
                                        <p>Madinat al-Hikmah, which means City of Knowledge and Learning, contains The Hamdard Public School, designed to impart training and education to 5000 children. It is affiliated to the UNESCO Associated Schools Projects. Hamdard University is also a part of this Madinat al-Hikmah.</p>
                                        <p>The Hamdard University with its constituent colleges and institutes namely The Hamdard College of Eastern Medicine, The Hamdard Institute of Education and Social Sciences, Hamdard Institute of Information Technology, Hamdard School of Law, Hamdard Institute of Management Sciences, Hamdard Al Majeed College of Eastern Medicine, Faculty of Engineering Science & Technology, Hamdard College of Medicine and Dentistry, Hafiz Mohammad Ilyas Institute of Pharmacology and Herbal Sciences, a teaching Hospital, The Bait al-Hikmah, which is the biggest library in Pakistan designed to hold two million books with attended facilities of reproduction micro film, microfiche, computerized holdings , rare books and manuscripts dating from 9th century onwards, Collection of coins , stamps and Photographs. There are well-equipped laboratories research and development for the use of national and international scholars. A key feature is the horticulture Garden built and maintained with the cooperation of the International Institute of Scientific Cooperation , Tubingen and the Ministry of Agriculture , Germany, where an extensive experimental cultivation of medicinal plants is carried out.</p>
                                        <p>The hydro chemical laboratory also operating under the same assistance advises and guides the surrounding rural areas and local farmers on profitable cultivation of crops and medicinal plants. </p>
                                        <p>Education through recreation is demonstrated thru the setting up of a children’s park “The Naunehal Shehar”where artifacts and presentations give children a broad-spectrum view of the world. Special programmes for children in the Hamdard Public School as part of the extra curricular activities are held for training in the art of leadership. Diffusion of Knowledge and information is achieved thru a regular publishing programme of books on varied subjects, Art, Literature, History, Religion, Science and Travel.</p>
                                        <p>Hamdard has built bridges of goodwill and cooperation in the world of learning thru organizing national and international conferences on special themes in medical, scientific, education and cultural fields. More than 500 international scholars and delegates have been welcomed at Hamdard. These conferences have been held at local convention centers or at Bait al Hikmah auditorium, where the facility of simultaneous interpretation in 5 languages is available. Residential facilities are provided to the delegates at the Scholars House, which is part of the Madinat al Hikmah.</p>
                                        <p>Philanthropy assumes many other forms, free eye camps, mobile dispensaries, outdoors clinics. Free medicines, scholarships to deserving students, health education thru the media, all these form part of Hamdard’s philanthropic activities.</p>
                                        <p>Future plans include the setting up of a Nations Ville for the meeting and congregation of scholars from all nations and international conference center, University residences, mosque, sports and youth centers, hospital and a house of peace.</p>
                                        <p>What is the philosophy that motivates Hamdard? It is the belief that no man is an island, that we should give to others as much as we receive. It is this belief that sustains our journey to strive for a better life, better education, and excellence in all undertakings. Much has been accomplished thru the efforts of Hamdard alone, much is to be done. The possibilities are limitless in the future but we need to hold hands with the rest of the world to sustain our faith and endeavor to share in the work for betterment, human welfare and universal peace.
